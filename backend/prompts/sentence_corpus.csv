So if it is the case then you must make peace.	35
We are a family we have to make peace with each other.	42
Have your opinions but dont unseen others too.	38
Having different thought is good.	28
But dont force to let others have the same thought.	41
We dont need any conflicts after this.	31
Help each other to get things done.	28
How is the performance of employees	30
Is everybodys working well	23
Lucy, give me a detailed report on this.	32
Rachel, I need detail of every employee.	33
Are they achieving their targets	28
If not then we have to take some strict actions.	38
I dont like doing this but it has to be done.	34
I want everybodys progress report.	29
We only want productive employees in our organization.	46
This is not a place for lazy people.	28
We want people to work efficiently.	29
Donna, give me the list of nonperforming employees.	43
We need to talk to them.	18

Sam, first listen to their problem.	29
Think about it and then you tell me.	28
Ill think of keeping them are not.	27
Mike, this is the last warning Im giving you.	36
Bravo, I hope you wont do this again.	29
Daniel, what Ive told you is the last time Im doing it.	43
I think this cannot be tolerated.	27
You will be suspended for two months.	30
If you are found to be improving then we can think again.	45
Rehiring will be done later on.	25
Theres room for improvement.	24
If you dont do this right it will be a problem for you.	42
Its a tough time for us also.	22
We dont like doing this.	19
Eric, I have lost all the patience.	28
I need to resign as soon as possible.	29
The management wants this to happen immediately.	41
Your consistently low performance is the reason.	41
Dont be disheartened youll get another opportunity.	44
Try searching somewhere else.	25
It was a pleasure having you on the team.	32
Learn from your mistakes.	21
Never make the same mistakes again.	29
Dont be unproductive in any organization you join.	42
Do you mind waiting a few minutes	27
Im calling to clarify.	18

Would you mind speaking up a bit	26
I cant hear you very well.	20
How about the following week.	24
Shall we say January 20	19
What would you suggest	19
Do you have a time in mind	20
Ill send you the report as soon as possible.	35
I will pay for this bill.	19
Not as far as Im concerned.	21
Not in my book.	11
Okay, it is by me.	13
See if I care	10
Go away and mind your own business	28
Not according to my views.	21
Thats fine with me.	15
I dont care if you do it.	18
Believe me I am telling you the truth.	30
Pain in the neck.	13
Say a word for word.	15
The way the wind blows.	18
I enjoyed meeting you, mark.	23
Dont worry, Ill make sure to stay in touch.	34
Have you seen the way she dresses	27
Oh, Ana, dont jump to conclusions	28
Are you going to come to Peru	23
Im not sure yet.	12
I need to sleep on it before giving you.	31
Well, its unusual nowadays.	23
What a small world	15
Seriously thats funny.	19
Oh no I forgot toothpaste	21
Never mind, we will just do it.	24
Oh, come on	9
I dont feel like going out tonight.	28
Come on, sheila, the band is great.	28
Okay. I guess its done.	17
Im sorry, it slipped my mind.	23
Sure. no problem.	13
Thanks. I owe you one.	16
How was your interview today	24
I think it went okay.	16
Hand in there, Stella.	18
What movie do you want to watch	25
Its up to you. I dont have a preference.	30
It is a pleasure to meet you.	22
At your earliest convenience.	25
Concerned about you always.	23
Firstly, let us talk about yesterday.	31
Give my regards to your grandfather.	30
Have you seen tom	14
I agree with my colleague, Anna, that hard work matters.	46
I would like to remind you that you have left up with the same work.	53
I appreciate your assistance	25
In light of fact that I owe you more always.	34
It is my opinion that once you meet your mom.	35
It is necessary for me to go to school.	30
It is not necessary for you to go out of the house.	39
It is recommended you go to the hospital.	33
Please accept our apologies for not accepting the gift.	46
Furthermore, we need to discuss our future together.	44
Lastly, I wasnt lying to you anything about last night.	45
She has the ability to speak in English.	32
The plan was implemented.	21
Our destination is not here, its in New Zealand.	39
I regret to inform you of the accident that happened yesterday night.	57
I was hoping that you could be here for me always.	39
It will cease to a problem that is yet to occur.	37
One grows weary in these matters.	27
This appeared to rectify the problem which was in past.	45
Your arrival was so late that I could not even wait.	41
Please state your business properly.	31
We note that you have not received your email.	37
I would be grateful if you could reply early as soon.	42
Id appreciate it if you could complete the task.	39
We would like to have the same ice cream.	32
Would you like me to have the photograph	33
To consider the same calculation you need to complete the task.	52
This demonstrates that we have completed the task for robot preparation.	61
To distinguish between what is right or wrong is a big question.	52
We receive the hospitality bill.	27
Revision should be done twice a day.	29
This will be of great benefit to you if done on regular basis.	49
I am writing to inform you about the health of my parents.	46
I am afraid I will not be able to attend the meeting.	41
Thank you for your email of the 10 of march.	34
Please let us know your requirements.	31
People consume a tremendous amount of electricity.	43
Please let me know when you will be available.	37
I hope to hear from you at your earliest convenience.	43
As per our telephone conversation on todays date.	41
We would be honored if you would attend this event.	41
We can assist in the resolution of this matter.	38
I am afraid your child is experiencing difficulty in listening.	53
I look forward to meeting you next week.	32
I think she is shy.	14
I feel it a too old one.	17
I guess its done actually.	21
In my view this room is awesome.	25
In my eyes, you are too pretty always.	30
From my perspective this scene is perfect.	35
From my viewpoint, this is the best dress.	34
I think we should leave now.	22
What I mean is to use tomato instead of onion.	36
Some people say that there is a big road which is too dangerous.	51
It is generally accepted that a girl takes all the responsibility.	55
It goes without saying that girls have to complete all household chores.	60
I think that uses only Indian products.	32
I believe that nature always heals the world.	37
I suppose you were present for the function.	36
According to my, the vegetable taste is too awesome.	43
In my opinion, this car is the best one for Rachel.	40
It seems to me that this is going to be the end of todays night.	49
From my point of view, this place is wonderful to have our house.	52
As far as Im concerned for his health, he needs special care now.	52
Id like to point out that this presentation was done by maam.	49
Well, it is considered that daughter in law takes over the charge of the home.	63
My impression is that she is a great artist.	35
I hold the view that she should wear it and then decide.	44
I agree with your mom nowadays more.	29
Definitely, this is going to be the best gift.	37
Absolutely, we need to think about this surely.	39
I see your point is right now, last night I didnt feel it.	45
I have to side with you on this one solution for this recipe.	48
I think so too that we need to draw it again.	34
Thats a good point that may elaborate on maths solutions in detail.	55
Youre right, thats a good point we can discuss it in the presentation.	57
Thats true, you should try it once again.	33
You have my full agreement of the rent house.	36
Ok, thats convincing that you need to go now at home.	42
You took the words right out of my mouth and she started to cry.	50
I agree that now dad should stay with us all.	35
I couldnt agree more that he wasnt nonviolent.	38
Precisely, he needs to understand the concept in deep.	45
I see what you are getting at nowadays after lockdown.	44
Sure, thats one way of looking at it, and its accepted.	44
I suppose that there would be bread and butter in the fridge.	49
I see exactly what you mean by hitting it badly.	38
I think youre right.	16
Well, I agree with you here.	22
I second that there would be an animal.	31
I take your word on it as it may give us a good path.	39
I see your point, but...	17
Thats one way of looking at it, however.	32
Well, I see things rather differently.	32
Im not sure I go along with that view.	29
I agree up to a point, but...	20
I wouldnt quite put it that way myself.	31
I cant go along with that.	20
Youve got to be kidding.	19
We dont seem to be in complete agreement.	33
I see what you are getting at, but...	27
I completely disagree.	19
Umm, Im not sure about that.	22
I dont really agree with that idea.	28
I still have my doubts.	18
Thats out of the question.	21
We dont seem to agree here.	21
Thats not always true.	18
Im afraid, I disagree.	18
Sorry to interrupt, but...	20
Is it ok if I jump in for a moment	25
If I may interrupt	15
Do you mind if I add something	24
Excuse me but in my opinion.	22
Excuse me for a second, but...	22
Let me finish what I have to say first.	30
Excuse me for interrupting, but...	27
Well, that reminds me of that.	24
I dont mean to intrude, but...	22
Sorry, but can you let me finish.	26
Before you go on, Id like to say something.	34
Just a moment, I like to add something here.	35
Can I add something here	20
If I might add something.	20
Can I throw my two cents in your one	28
Umm, well not really but I dont want to talk to you.	40
Are you telling me that this is going to be my work	40
Sorry, but Im not done yet.	21
May I say something here	20
Sorry to cut you off, but...	20
Well, if that is the case...	20
Wait a minute, let me take my bag too.	29
The next point Id like to make is...	26
Moving right along from this path.	28
That brings us to the child whom we met before.	37
My first point is.	14
Now the situation is to sit at home and study for further.	46
Not only you but jenny too need to work on this.	37
As you can see from these examples.	28
Finally, I am here at my goal point.	28
Now that we have established.	24
Keeping these points in mind.	24
Now that we understand that we need to move.	35
Lets begin with a further chapter.	28
My next example is regarding spiders.	31
Likewise, we need to look further into our company.	42
In the same way, we need to print on the same duplicate paper.	49
In a like manner, we always move further in life.	39
In addition to this, we also need one more offer.	39
Contrast that with other colors.	27
At the same time, we also need to look at other responsibilities.	53
Now lets consider this example again so that we can correlate.	51
However, we also need to go to another site.	35
Nevertheless, we need to go further still.	35
Furthermore, we also find some more evidence.	38
If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, you are a leader.	61
If you think you can do a thing, youre right.	35
The great teacher inspires.	23
Indeed it is the only thing that ever has.	33
You can speak well if your tongue can deliver the message of your heart.	58
Let thy speech be better than silence, or be silent.	42
A good orator is pointed and impassioned.	34
Before anything else, preparation is the key to success.	47
There are two types of speakers in the world, the nervous and liars.	55
It takes one hour of preparation for each minute of presentation time.	58
The most precious things in speech are the.. pauses.	41
Welltimed silence hath more eloquence than speech.	43
Always give a speech that you would like to hear.	39
Speeches measured by hour die with the hour.	36
Only the prepared speaker deserves to be confident.	43
To sway an audience, you must watch them as you speak.	43
A presentation is a chance to share, not an oral exam.	43
The world is waiting for your words.	29
If God is in the details, then the devil is in PowerPoint.	46
Some people talk in their sleep, lecturers talk while other people sleep.	61
To hear his lecture.	16
The trouble with a lecture is that it answers questions.	46
The moment the feeling enters the body is political.	43
What an amazing gift to help people, not just yourself.	45
Define a successful lecturer.	25
Knowing the topic of the lecture very well.	35
Being well prepared for the lecture.	30
So she was waiting for the lecture.	28
Silence always led to a lecture.	26
Do we have to give lectures in twelve hours	35
Form for a striking lecture.	23
There is no smarter professor than life and no wiser sage than experience.	61
Comic books in a lecture.	20
First few lectures here.	20
Fiction can show you a different world.	32
Anyone can lecture from the butt.	27
Whats happening is a very stern lecture.	33
The lecture will become a spanking.	29
I notice that, in the lecture.	24
Hold forth.	9
Take the floor.	12
A true dreamer is one who knows how to navigate in the dark.	47
We are going to have another department meeting.	40
Lets hold a meeting to discuss this.	29
Did you go to the project team meeting	31
Did not attend the development meeting.	33
The meeting minutes.	17
Meetings are held to collaborate.	28
Some meetings use a formal system of voting.	36
Hello, everyone. thank you for coming today.	36
Since everyone is here, lets get started.	34
Id like to take a moment to introduce to our new manager.	45
Please join me in welcoming.	23
Sheila, would you like to introduce yourself	38
As you can see from the agenda, well be talking about it.	45
Ive called this meeting too.	23
Our main goal today is to.	20
What does everyone think about it	28
Id like to get your feedback on the same page of Facebook.	46
What are your thoughts about this situation	37
What are your views on this plan	26
What does everyone else think	25
Are there any other comments	24
Susan, can we get your input	23
Would you like to add anything, joe	29
I strongly believe that.	20
I have no doubt whatsoever that.	26
I think we have to go this way.	23
Believe me, this is going to be the best moment for us.	43
I feel that this is the last day of life.	31
From my point of view, this is perfect.	31
In my experience, this is going to be the right way.	41
I find that this is the last solution which I may get now.	45
Id say that.	9
If you want my honest opinion, I think that.	35
To be honest with you I want to go now.	29
It seems to me that I am the last one left.	32
Its possible that we can go further on this.	35
I tend to think that this is going to be the last tracking.	46
My initial reaction is anger always.	30
I completely agree.	16
I couldnt agree more.	17
Thats just how I see it.	18
Im with Peter on this.	17
Well, it depends totally on your point of view.	38
I agree with you up to a point, but not now.	33
I agree with you in principle, but I dont want to obey those.	48
Im afraid I disagree with this thing.	30
Im not so sure that this is going to be right.	35
I see it differently nowadays based on situations.	42
Yes, but you need to understand it once.	32
Not necessarily this is going to be the best one for always.	48
Im sorry, but I completely disagree.	30
Im sorry, but I dont agree with that at all.	34
We dont seem to be getting anywhere with this.	37
Lets move on.	10
I think were going to have to agree to disagree.	38
We could have completed his last wish.	31
Why dont you help me	16
How about todays evening	21
What about your plan	17
Why dont we go with them	19
I suggest she stay here with mom.	26
I recommend using the same paper.	27
We should not go to the hospital.	26
Lets wait and look at the situation which is best for her.	46
I recommend using the same sheets.	28
We should go to the hospital.	23
I think weve spent enough time on this topic. moving on.	44
If nobody has anything else to add, lets move on to the next item.	52
Were running short on time, so lets move on.	35
Id like to skip item 2 and go directly to item 3.	37
Id like to hand it over to Brian, who is going to lead the next point.	54
Next, Brain is going to tell us about it.	32
Im afraid thats outside the scope of this meeting.	41
I think were getting a bit offtopic.	29
Wed better save that for another meeting.	34
Lets get back on track, ok	21
Getting back to.	13
It looks like weve covered the main items on the agenda.	45
That will be all for today.	21
If no one has anything else add, then I think well wrap this up.	50
Our next meeting will be on Friday.	28
Lets get together next month.	24
First, let me introduce myself.	26
Let me start by giving you some background information.	46
Lets move on to our second slide.	26
Turning our attention now to the results.	34
Id like to expand on my point.	23
Let me elaborate further.	21
As I said at the beginning, well see an increase in profit.	47
This relates to what I was saying earlier about increasing production.	59
This ties in with the way weve been doing business.	41
The significance of this is if we complete the project on the schedule date.	62
This is important because any marketing effort we put in now will help to boost.	65
We have to remember that people are the most important resources.	54
According to our study, working people in the city go directly to the gym.	60
Id like to illustrate this point by showing you a chart.	45
This chart shows a breakdown of the ingredients.	40
In other words, we need to change our design.	36
To put it simply, well need you to work.	31
What I mean to say is that we need to change the way.	40
In conclusion, let me sum up my main points.	35
Thank you for your attention.	24
Now I am happy to answer any questions you might have.	43
Can we proceed with conclusions	27
Please someone among you tries to answer the questions.	46
I have a question for you all about this context.	39
Can we have some more questions here	30
Is the topic completely understood	30
Can we expect good results among these projects	40
I think we need to work more with these slides.	37
Can we come up with a summary	23
I want to thank you for considering me.	31
Im glad you called me because I want to work for this company.	49
Im here because I think I have the profile.	34
I want to congratulate you on making this company capable.	48
I am sorry, would you please repeat the question	40
Excuse me, I didnt even hear you, can you please say it again	49
Could you please repeat the same question	35
Speak a little bit loud.	19
Sorry, I didnt hear the last part.	27
I think Im the right choice for the job.	31
My patience will allow me to do this easily.	35
Id love to work here because I do love to explore a new world.	48
I can let you know some skills.	24
Please justify the strength which you have.	36
Can you tell me something about yourself	34
How did you come across this course	29
What are you expecting from us more	29
I am very thankful for this.	22
I hope we see each other again.	24
I wanted to thank you before I leave.	29
It was my pleasure to meet you again.	29
I want you to thank you for having me here.	33
Ive been looking for this position for a long time.	41
Im glad that I was recommended.	25
Love for all, hatred for none.	24
Change the world by being yourself.	29
Every moment is a fresh beginning.	28
Never regret anything that made you smile.	35
Die with memories, not dreams.	25
Aspire to inspire before we expire.	29
Everything you can imagine is real.	29
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.	37
Whatever you do, do it well.	22
What we think, we become.	20
Tough times never last but tough people do.	35
Problems are not stopped signs, they are guidelines.	44
If Im gonna tell a real story, Im gonna start with my name.	46
If you tell the truth you dont have to remember anything.	46
Have enough courage to start and enough heart to finish.	46
Hate comes from intimidation, love comes from appreciation.	51
I could agree with you but then wed both be wrong.	39
Oh, the things you can find, if you dont stay behind.	42
Determine your priorities and focus on them.	37
Be so good they cant ignore you.	25
Dream as if youll live forever, live as if youll die today.	47
Yesterday you said tomorrow. just do it.	32
I dont need it to be easy, I need it to be worth it.	38
Never let your emotions overpower your intelligence.	45
Nothing lasts forever but at least we got these memories.	47
Dont you know your imperfections is a blessing	39
Reality is wrong, dreams are for real.	31
To live will be an awfully big adventure.	33
There is no substitute for hard work.	30
What consumes your mind controls your life.	36
Strive for greatness.	18
Wanting to be someone else is a waste of who you are.	41
And still, I rise.	14
The time is always right to do what is right.	35
Let the beauty of what you love to be what you do.	38
May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.	43
A happy soul is the best shield for a cruel world.	39
White is not always light and black is not always dark.	44
Happiness depends upon ourselves.	29
Turn your wounds into wisdom.	24
It hurt because it mattered.	23
If the world was blind how many people would you impress	46
I will remember and recover, not forgive and forget.	43
The meaning of life is to give life meaning.	35
To be honest.	10
To tell you the truth.	17
Believe me	9
Let me be clear.	12
The fact is.	9
So rich as honesty.	15
It takes strength and courage to admit the truth.	40
Honesty never hides the deeds.	25
Honesty tells the truth.	20
A halftruth is a whole lie.	21
Be honest with yourself.	20
Honest is more.	12
Do believe, I am honest.	19
She expressed her honesty always.	28
No legacy is rich than honesty.	25
Her honesty helps to build trust.	27
See, her honesty looks like.	23
Ohh, she expresses to him her honesty.	31
First honesty, then industry.	25
The mans honesty is true	20
A mans honesty is seen in his eyes, you know about it	42
Lifes lesson is honesty first.	25
Her integrity was more to tell her.	28
Be yourself everyone else is already taken.	36
Honesty helps always.	18
Its discouraging that employees arent honest.	39
Its better to offer no excuse than a bad one.	35
You cant lie to your soul.	20
Please do not lie now.	17
Honesty changes real things.	24
Honesty says a lot.	15
Still best to be honest and truthful.	30
Honesty is the first chapter.	24
It takes courage and strength to admit.	32
Honest people dont hide.	20
Something honest.	15
Honest is more what I mean.	21
Integrity is telling myself the truth.	32
Love is honesty.	13
Friends are honest.	16
Honesty is very expensive.	22

Delegate work works, provided the delegating works, too.	48
Youve got to learn to delegate.	25

The first rule is to delegate in management.	36
You can never delegate responsibility for delegating a task.	51

Yes, Ill do that.	13
Okay, what is your biggest concern	29
So you feel like... is that correct	26
I appreciate all you do.	19
Lets see if I understood this correctly, what youre saying is...	51
Lets get some ice cream and talk about this some more.	43
Im sorry. I take responsibility for that.	33

From next month we will start the process of automation.	46
It has been a long time we did some updates.	34
Yes sir it is the right time to automate the processes.	44
Everyone is now used to the old process.	32
This has to be changed to create innovation.	36
Lucy, carry out research on this topic.	32
Rachel, you go through the past records.	33
Joe, check for previous human errors.	31
We want to achieve the 99.99 percent accuracy level.	42

We have to distribute the workforce as per the department.	48
These are the orders from the management.	34
We will give the task force as per the desired projects.	45
As of now, there is no proper workforce assigned.	40
Right sir this was always in my mind.	29
Ok, then people we have to distribute then manpower now.	46
I think most of the people will be required in production.	47
Yes sir we think that the assembly line is a very critical area.	51
We need many men to handle the assembly line.	36
Skilled labor is needed on the line.	29
Joe, get all the skilled labors details.	33
We will sort the laborers as per their skill set.	39
Emma, do we have the welding people around	35
We also want some casting skill manpower.	34
Casting products will be produced from next month	42
We have to hire some new talent.	25
Or else we can train our workforce for specific skills.	45
Mia, what do you think about the plan	30
Yes maam you are correct but we have to ask the management.	47
Dont worry Ill talk to those people.	29
Ok, then sir Ill search for some skilling agencies.	42
We can call these people at our campus to train.	38
The training was much needed for our labors.	36
But still, we have the bestskilled workforce in our company.	50
Bella, do one thing call everyone in the auditorium.	43
Ok, but for what maam if I may ask	26

You have to be a quick team.	21
You know that raw material is the key component.	39
We cannot unseen this issue right	28
John, get the requirements to form everyone.	37
Mike, will you carry out all the calculations	38
Do we need to talk to the purchasing team	33
Yes maam can we ask for their help	27
Yea sure why not it is their job to do.	29
David, talk to the purchase head.	27

Dine sir Ill get it by the purchasing team.	34
Harry, can you go to the previous vendor	33
I want some specification brochures.	31
Ok, sir I already scheduled a visit to them.	35
Max, we need some samples for testing.	31
Yes maam Ill ask for that soon.	24
Rachel, will you check with the technician.	36
I want all the samples to be tested before we order.	41
This will refrain us from getting the product spoiled.	45
Last time people had some complaints.	31
I think the raw material was not good enough.	36
This time we will make sure we get the best quality.	41
Good quality will also increase the machines life.	42
Yes sir we agree with your theory.	27
I also had the same view.	19
Lucy, conduct a survey with the union leaders.	38
Rachel, you can ask the labors about the quality.	40
These labor people know better about the quality.	41
If we give them a better feed they will produce the best.	45
Mia, follow up with the reporting head.	32
Team, I think there will be an audit next week.	37
We need to ensure full capacity production.	36
These audit people are very strict.	29

Do you think they have increased the price	35
Yes sir they have increased a lot this time	35

We have been procuring from them for a decade.	37
We need a discount on our goodwill.	28
Whats the exact stock of the product left	34
Are we planning the inventory as per the guideline	42
We were short of stocks last time.	27
Please all ensure it wont happen this time.	35
Right sir, actually we had a team meeting last night.	43
We have come to a fruitful conclusion.	31

If we dont deliver on time it gives a bad impression.	42
Yes maam we wont let that happen.	26
Joe, get all the documents ready for stock inventory.	44
Are we keeping the invoice copy for every stock	39
Yes sir it is been stored in the inventory room.	38
Ok then lets move the products to the final lines.	40
As soon as the demand rises level up the inventory.	41
More demand needs more inventory to keep.	34
Megan, you talk to the finance head.	29
Ask them if we have enough budget for demand rise.	40
There is a chance of a rise in demand next month.	38
For that, we need to plan inventory from next week.	41
Yes sir we were pretty much aware of that.	33
Olivia, check the latest reports on the demand rise.	43
I think we will need more stock of product c.	35
Sam, check how much we have product c in the inventory.	44
This one is in more demand since last month.	35
John, I hope youll plan your requirement as per our discussion.	52
I have already done that my inventory is full.	37
I only need support from the sales team.	32
They have to speed up sales to reduce inventory costs.	44
Sir some products do incur a lot of inventory costs.	42
Actually, these are the products that need regular checks.	49
It costs us more to take care of such stock.	34
No issue well address the problem in the next meeting.	44
Mike, are you aware of your products inventory	39
Maam actually my product sells smoothly.	34
I dont have any issues in keeping the stocks.	36
My team is handling the inventory very well.	36

The new products are inflammable maam.	32
We need at least ten more of those items.	32
Ok then Rachel, order it as fast as possible.	36
We cannot take a risk with peoples life.	32
Yes maam Ill ask for the quotation first.	33
Emma will choose which one should be installed.	39

You can also keep the good ones.	25
Just try to replace the lights which are too old.	39
I want everybody to see clearly in the warehouse.	40
Sam, ask the cleaning staff to come in the evening as well.	47
We have to take the utmost care to keep the warehouse clean.	48
Which are stocks we are keeping in this warehouse	41
How much capacity does this warehouse have	36
Sir actually capacity is not much but the facilities are more.	51
Ok then do one thing transfer all the product c here.	42
These products need more care.	25
John, youll manage this warehouse from now.	36
Jack, I need you to prepare the timetable for the warehouse staff.	54
Ok maam do you want anything to add specifically	40
David, do we have good ladders in the warehouse	39

Lucy, you also give the list of products vendors.	40
How many vendors we have outsourced as of now	37
Sir actually 30 percent of vendors are outsourced.	42
Ok fine, then we have to allocate proper incentives to them.	49
Rachel, how is it going with the vendor from Germany	43
Pretty well sir those people are good in conversation.	45
Yes, I also thought when we finalized them as a permanent vendor.	53
Do we have any issues pending to solve	31
Yes maam there are issues with vendors from the western zone.	50
Their people from west always has some issue.	37
The thing there a stronghold of Microsoft companys vendors.	50
They try to disturb all the marketspace.	33
Mia, hand over me the final documents.	31
Emma, check with the vendor for the order date.	38
We have to build strong relations with these vendors.	44
As these are the people who will supply us with the right material.	54
You, people, knowhow important quality material is to us.	48
Yes sir we understand your concern.	29
We are trying to build a good rapport with them.	38
Maam but some vendors are very rude.	29
They dont pick up calls regularly.	28
Bella, note down the issues with them.	31
He will try to resolve every problem in some days.	40
If you have a strong reason then we can replace that vendor.	48
Megan, you told me last time some issue with b vendor.	43
Yes sir there was something but we resolved it.	38
Thats such a smart move you have taken.	31
Im very proud of you people.	22

This will help you in being a good future operations leader.	49
Our job is to make things work smoothly.	32

Harry, go talk to the security head.	29
Max, have planned a meet with product b vendors	39
How many deliveries have to be scheduled for next week	45
Lucy, give me the details of these deliveries.	38
This time the freight charges will higher.	35
It is because of the rise in fuel prices.	32
Rachel, what was the freight charge or last delivery	44
Sir, we charged five thousand bucks for that freight.	44
Oh is it, thats quite expensive.	26
Ok, let it be we will try our best to lower that cost.	41
Emma, from which are we sending the trucks	35
Maam those drivers have their defined routes.	38
Ok, are we giving the new routes to follow	34
No, they are reluctant on that part.	29
See this is the problem truck drivers dont listen only.	45
Mia, ask the fleet owner to call me.	28
Ok sir Ill fix the con call on Monday.	29
Sir, I have a doubt why are these drivers so rude	39
The thing is a single freight takes at least fifteen hours to complete.	58
These drivers get very tired.	24
Thats why some drivers are rude and reluctant to listen.	46
On what basis we are charging them for a single freight	45
Maam, it depends on the material weight and distance.	44
We charge more if the distance is too long.	34
Are we giving them a discount on toll taxes	35
No maam they only said theyll manage.	30
Ok fine then this issue is solved.	27
Bella, we want freezer trucks to schedule the next freight.	49
Ok, sir then Ill find out such type of fleet owners.	41

See these kinds of people we want in business.	37
Our supply chain is three phases.	27
Rachel, were you aware of this	25
No sir but Im eager to learn about this.	31
See our supply is based on production.	31
Later we send it to the warehouse.	27
Emma, do you know the next phase.	26
Yes sir then we send it to the distributors.	35
Yes, you are absolutely correct.	27
This is called the primary billing phase.	34
Here the business starts moving forward.	34

Im a bit confused about that can you explain.	36
Sure Ill let you know today all about the supply chain.	44

She didnt come here to talk to me.	26
Are you here again	15
Pause here to take a breath.	22
Shell have to stay here tonight.	26
Strange, it had never seemed lonely here before.	40
He has been here for about an hour.	27
I believe they are all here, said one.	30
Megan should be here any minute.	26
What makes you think i came here to see you	34
Our press that button there.	23
Put it over there.	14
There it is, on the sink.	19
There came a giant to my door.	23
There are twenty boys in this class.	29
There is a cow in the garden.	22
Without health, there is no happiness.	32
There are three ways.	17
Thus there are two numbers in english.	31
There are many different people in europe.	35
There is little time for preparation.	31
There are no pictures in this book.	28
There should not be much talk.	24
There were riots in delhi.	21
There was not the slightest excuse for it.	34
I knew he was there.	15
I do not know who is there.	20
I will take you there one day.	23
Lay the basket there.	17
There are on the committee among others.	33
There are two articles.	19
There are two ways of doing the sum.	28
There is a flaw in this diamond.	25
There is little hope of his recovery.	30
There lived a giant.	16
There were doors all round the hall.	29
Wait there.	9
What is there that i do not know	25
Is there a bank around here	22
Who goes there	12
Yet there is the method in it.	23
You see him there.	14
Bid him go there.	13
He is not there.	12
He was there.	10
I have to be there at five oclock.	26
I used to live there when i was a boy.	28
I was there,.	10
There are several ways.	19
There arent any left for you.	23
Therefor five years.	17
There is a growing tendency.	23
There is a screw loose somewhere.	27
There is much truth in what he says.	28
There she goes.	12
There was not a moment to be lost.	26
There was nothing for it to fight.	27
They were there.	13
Unfortunately, no one was present there.	34
Come away from there.	17
Hang the picture there.	19
He comes from there.	16
He must have reached there.	22
He was discharged as there was no proof.	32
Sam went there on my bike.	20
There are many rumors in the bazar.	28
There are some diseases.	20
There is a big tree in front of his house.	32
There is a cow in the field.	21
There is no authority.	18
There is no exception.	18
There is no meaning in what you say.	28
There is still no cure.	18
There were three other boys present.	30
There werent many people at the meeting.	33
We should go there tomorrow evening.	30
There is no other way.	17
It was hot out there.	16
Its there, so use it.	16
I was there for him.	15
There was a blue flash.	18
There was more to it.	16
There is no life in.	15
There is a time and.	15
There is no life too.	16
There was a knockon.	16
There is a paradox here.	19
So there we are, right.	18
In others, there it is.	18
There were four of them.	19
There seemed to be no.	17
I had brought you there.	19
There is no going back.	18
There were many of them.	19
There is no such thing.	18
There is a short silence.	20
It is there with death.	18
We have to go in there.	17
There was no other way.	18
There were two of them.	18
There was no one inside.	19
David did have to stop there.	23
For a moment there was.	18
Harry will be there for you.	22
Their mole had given a.	18
Then there are the gangs.	20
There has to be a reason.	19
Daniel is there with him.	20
He was aware that there.	19
No one has.	8
I will be there in five.	18
There is a wonder in most.	20
There was a small table.	19
Its not there anymore.	18
There were only two beds.	20
This is mine.	10
I like this, he said, zipping it up.	28
This is our planting ground.	23
This might be the most difficult discussion.	37
And stop this making before the kids come in.	36
Many changed in these seventy years of life.	36
This was a decision she had already made.	33
This isnt a good time.	17
At least at this point, dont go.	25
Waiting this long might have been an advantage.	39
I want this baby as much as you do, alex.	31
This time he didnt simply indicate what he felt.	39
This isnt easy for you, is it	23
How else would you explain things like this	36
Dont open this door.	16
Lucy had come this far for vegetables.	31
Cade had been busy this morning.	26
Bandages are not for things like this, anyway.	38
Im old and weak and this is what you wanted	34
I agreed to this because of the baby.	29
Its none of my business how you run this outfit.	38
Whats this she said, frowning.	25
I should get rid of this and buy something else.	38
Maybe this was his expression of resistance.	37
Megan should discuss all this with alex.	33
He had hidden it from her all this time.	31
Dont blame her for the lack of attention this time.	41
Im the one who dragged you into this.	29
Why did you do all this	18
Daniel gave this picture to me.	25
And this must be mr.	15
This is his woman now.	17
How do i know this	14
This was going to be.	16
I just made this up.	15
Ants are good at this.	17
Think of it like this.	17
This is quite a boat.	16
I just love this game.	17
This was not good news.	18
By the way, this is.	15
I think this is a test.	17
This is how the name.	16
How did i know this	15
As he did this, son.	15
But i do know this.	14
While this is true, we.	18
So lets dive into this.	18
He had no time for this.	18
This happens in a day.	17
This is the power of god.	19
This is not a love song.	18
You can stop this, baby.	19
This is the end of me.	16
This is at our disposal.	19
Why not keep this up	16
If this spirit is not.	17
God teaches us this way.	19
You have to do this.	15
What the hell is this	17
I was surprised by this.	19
Share this with your friends.	24
This is as it should be.	18
They camped on this site.	20
Say this prayer with me.	19
Of course, this took time.	21
This is what we need, mr.	19
I dont understand this.	19
This is your truth, mac.	19
This truth sets us free.	19
I have heard of this wonderful magic.	30
This is our plantingground.	23
About this time i found out the use of a key.	34
Im too warm in this one.	18
But this wasnt just any trip.	23
This is the usa.	12
This wasnt the alex she knew.	23
This dog helped him watch the sheep.	29
Now eat with this.	14
This is a fine meal, do you think	26
Youve paid a dear price for this thing.	31
This is our home.	13
This does not bother you	20
This was the final step.	19
Lets talk about this.	17
We need some fresh air in this stuffy room	34
I should have anticipated this.	26
Is it this house	13
But this wasnt about intimacywas it	30
Im old and weak and this is what you wanted.	34
Could all this be happening to her	28
The pear trees are blossoming out early this year.	41
What had she been thinking of all this time	35
This train conveys passengers to london.	34
This is a nice scrape youve got me into, isnt it	38
We are all vegetable, in this country.	31
But this was not true.	17
In the first place, he didnt consider this home.	39
Someone else carries this baby for you.	32
This world belongs to the energetic.	30
Is it always like this	18
And he loves you this much	21
It always comes down to this, doesnt it	32
This is not enough for alex to support	31
Rose, this is bravo, felipe introduced her.	36
This time it will be a long one.	24
Do you know the meaning of this word	29
No, only in this county.	19
She should discuss all this with alex.	31
Do you have much room for this new baby	31
Since you arrived, she is not sure this is the way.	40
I do not want all this.	17
Will this be your last baby	22
Who was paying for this	19
This came in by currier a few minutes ago, sir.	37
No, this one is ours.	16
May i have this dance	17
This will take us most of the way.	26
That dog is hers.	13
Clean that table.	14
That toaster burned my bagel.	24
I thought that was the best way to carry her.	35
Eric was thinking to hide a thing like that from you.	42
Well, if my cooking is that bad.	25
That was when mary decided to relieve her mind.	38
Harry spoke so well that everybody was pleased.	39
It was the first time she thought of mary that way.	40
Stop bugging her about that thing.	28
Jack stopped and picked up a birds nest that had fallen.	45
That i am not prepared to say.	23
I am greater than that sorcerer.	26
Did i ever tell you that youre the most handsome man	42
After that other people brought water from a brook.	42
That is if jim has had enough of the pink grass.	37
It is with a kind of fear that i begin to write the history.	46
What do you mean by that asked the little wizard.	39
That was a nobrainer.	17
But i noticed that many queer things have happened.	42
I wonder why it is that we can walk so easily in the air.	43
No one could deny that alex was a devoted husband.	40
That didnt sound very nice.	22
But even that did not satisfy the princess.	35
Baby birds were there, that had not fallen out.	38
I know better than that.	19
Lets just leave it at that.	21
I was so excited that i couldnt sleep.	30
Do you know that	13
Thats what you get for waiting so long.	31
Thats easy for you to say.	20
I guess that will do.	16
That would change when they got home.	30
Rose was so exhausted that he couldnt pick up bill.	41
That sounds like her fever finally broke.	34
Crackling is much better than that faint wheezing.	42
Anna came home that evening very tired.	32
Yet one has just occurred that was even worse.	37
There was an object that looked like a balloon.	38
Did alex think of her that way	24
Later, he said that with a grin.	25
Dont hide from me that i havent already seen	36
Now thats splitting hairs.	22
Ive waited at that station for five hours.	34
David thought that was all to say.	27
How can we do that asked the girl.	26
Do i look that bad	14
That seemed unlikely, though.	25
We can call it that.	15
That was our deb year.	17
I got that kind of.	14
With that, he was gone.	18
That is why i will.	14
I go along with that.	16
That is kind of them.	16
So far today that was.	17
That is why in that.	15
And that is the point.	17
She went to work on that.	19
Look at that, will you	18
Im tired of that game.	17
It is my prayer.	12
Anna would not do that.	18
That throws me a little.	19
If that is true what.	16
Even he could see that.	18
He could see that now.	17
So jack did just that.	17
And that is a process.	17
Consider that in the u.	18
I have to laugh at that.	18
Even i dont know that.	17
But you dont know that.	18
I dont see it that way.	17
I preferred it that way.	19
Oh, give up on that one.	18
They do not think that.	18
That time is ticking by.	19
If that makes any sense.	19
Me and my mom, that is.	17
It was as simple as that.	19
Cant say that i have.	16
And what would that be	18
All told, that was that.	19
I cling to that thought.	19
I get that in that club.	18
A horse stumbles that has four legs.	29
He that will thrive must rise at five.	30
He that regards not a penny, will lavish a pound.	39
He that fears death lives not.	24
Can i have one of these	18
You can use any one of these.	22
These are my other two daughters, joe and anna.	38
Quick harry, help me pull off these wooden wings	40
They carry these at the store.	24
These were temptations of the devil.	30
Do you treat these calls differently	31
King was very intrigued by all these oracles.	37
Im quite worn out by these callers.	28
Max knew that these were the eyes of the wolf.	36
I guess not but please take down all these details.	41
I took the liberty of confirming some of these cases.	43
But she drove these thoughts away with disgust.	39
It comforted him to hear these arguments.	34
These silly jobs didnt make her a living.	33
These could be hallucinations, couldnt they	38
These belonged to aunt annie too	27
Do you know what these are going to be yet	33
I have all these visions in my head.	28
You have magic in these hands.	24
After all these years, he still held regrets.	37
Now, where do i put these	20
Im going to get out of these wet clothes.	32
Are these womens clothes	21
These are from anna.	16
These men arent wearing western uniforms.	35
These doctors will take care of the injured.	36
I will go out and see some of these things.	33
For these live by faith.	19
It was during these long.	20
Most of these you take.	18
God, i hated these places.	21
These are not old times.	19
All these gifts begin to.	20
I put these into the sack.	20
These things were not me.	20
Loves me more than these	20
At least these could be.	19
All of these ports were.	19
These went to the stream.	20
As i do these things, i.	18
Withal of these, every.	19
Dead these many years now.	21
I have waited these hours.	21
I have witnessed these wars.	23
Even in all these letters	21
Many of these warriors had.	22
These he stuffed into the.	21
But these are modern times.	22
All these humans were the.	21
Pay attention to these two.	22
All these things i loathe.	21
I hate these fucking doors.	22
We will debate these issues.	23
These words are only used.	21
Where did you get these	19
Mack, these are just great.	22
These weapons of your life.	22
Note these in your journal.	22
Average of these four years.	23
Yes, these shall be gathered.	24
These are wounds at that time.	24
Women dont do these things.	22
But what had these animals.	22
These cones are so full of.	21
These events were not normal.	24
As you have told us, these.	21
Now, many people have these.	23
Are these bears here	17
The worst misfortunes are these that never happen.	42
Hows your mother doing these days	28
How long would these mind games go on	30
Im talking about the safety of these people.	36
Youll have to show me these beautiful flowers.	38
These are my other two daughters, daniel and anna.	41
Who built these lovely bridges asked the little girl.	44
So you must be careful not to spend these foolishly.	42
If they could talk, what tales these hills could tell.	44
Nobody could answer these questions.	31
These ships were loaded with corn.	28
These steps lead to the land of the gargoyles.	37
One of these days is none of these days.	31
These are friends, not enemies.	26
Can it be proved that he did commit these offenses	41
Why hadnt she anticipated these questions	36
How will we see these discontinuities coming	38
These are friends and will do you no harm.	33
Quick bravo, help me pull off these wooden wings	40
They carry these at the store where we always shop.	41
Are these ingredients in other foods as well	37
Are you prepared to repeat these allegations in court	45
Its impossible to be accurate about these things.	41
Im all for putting these guys down.	28
But these doubts only lasted a moment.	31
These treaties are good.	20
These ideas have now been completely discarded.	40
These bloody lessons would sober most people down.	42
She has built these scraps of metal into a sculpture.	43
He knew that these were the eyes of the wolf.	35
Are you sure these documents belong together	38
So how do these things get made	25
Where did you get all these questions	31
These cakes are very quick and easy to make.	35
Tell me about these bones.	21
Do you ever ride one of these	23
I need to paint those windows.	24
What color are those	17
Those films are being made now.	25
Besides, those are my animals.	25
Those eyes would be mocking her.	26
Do those two things even compare	27
Those jeans make your legs look so long.	32
Those hospital corridors are long.	29
My parents used to listen to those old songs.	36
Those words stayed in her mind all afternoon.	37
Joe couldnt have forgotten those eyes.	32
Daniel, we all agreed on those rules.	30
In those days, people are kind to each other.	36
Ill take care of those details.	25
See those clouds how they hang	25
A touch of humor flashed in those blue pools.	36
I think i shall never revisit those scenes.	35
What if a snake had been in those bushes	32
To me, those stories feel a bit desperate.	34
I take it you dont want to fix those snakes.	34
Its awful with those sausage eaters	30
He saw the kind faces of those whom he loved.	35
The answers to those questions are in this book.	39
Those are the things to be seen.	25
Those ideas were stolen from me.	26
Those people are very insane.	24
It was one of those breakthrough moments.	34
Those are the plain and simple facts.	30
Then more in one year than those five.	30
Are those our men there	19
Ah, those are the french	20
Eric could have gone to get those troops.	33
See what you can do with those.	24
Fourteen lefttwo of those wounded.	29
I tossed you about those rabbits.	27
I guess those are all excuses.	24
I suppose he missed those.	21
Id outgrown those feelings, hadnt i	30
Those were the last words spoken by him.	32
This causes them to be drawn to those flowers.	37
What about those we were accusing	28
Those that do not will.	18
Like those porn flicks we.	21
When we fight as those.	18
Whats up with those two.	19
Some of those may have.	18
For those who would delude.	22
I need those magic hands.	20
Those that are should not.	21
Oh the idiocy of those.	18
Those carbs that are from.	21
For those who act in the.	19
One of those pensive ones.	21
Those who live by faith.	19
Who truly weep over those.	21
One of those options is.	19
Max can elaborate on those.	22
Killed two of those bastards.	24
We call on those groups.	19
Give me two of those torches.	23
The strikes of those from.	21
I was not one of those girls.	22
Those prey to them wishes to.	23
Those who want to seem more.	22
Today was one of those days.	22
Why are those men here	18
Those who have great cal.	20
I can eat without those.	19
Those who are in the bible.	21
Each of those people would.	22
What those anglos did to us.	22
Those men with whom you were.	23
Those that were healed began.	24
Its neither of those things.	23
He seemed to be one of those.	22
We just have to cross those.	22
You cant have grown those.	21
Those, on the contrary, for.	23
But those are merely words.	22
Those were years of transition.	26
Good things come to those who wait.	28
None are so deaf as those who will not hear.	34
Miracles are to those who believe in them.	34
None so blind as those who wont see.	28
Theres none so blind as those who will not see.	37
None so deaf as those that wont hear.	29

This is a color television.	22
Vanity is the food of fools.	22

Could you explain to me	19
Could someone please tell me	24
Just tell me the reason why	22
I dont really understand	21
I just dont see why.	15
Are you saying that	16
I beg your pardon	14
I didnt quite get that. excuse me, did you say that	40
Do you have an idea	15
Is it right what ive done	20
I just dont see why	15
Are you aware of	13
Would you support the view that	26
Whats your take on	15
When you say, do you mean	20
In my view.	8
As far as i can see.	14
As far as im concerned.	18
It seems to me that.	15
Well, id say.	10
If you want my opinion.	18
You can take it from me that.	22
First of all id like point out.	24
First to start with id like point out.	30
What we have to decide is.	20
There can be no doubt that.	21
Its a fact that.	12
Nobody will deny that.	18
The way i see it everyone knows.	25
The way as i see it everyone knows.	27
Let me put it this way.	17
Let me put it another way.	20
Lets get this clear.	16
Sorry to interrupt you, but.	23
The point im trying to make is.	24
Personally speaking i think.	24
Im absolutely convinced that.	25
My view is that.	12
My point of view is that.	19
The way i look at it is this.	21
The way i look see it is this.	22
What i actually meant was.	21
I have seen that.	13
I have noticed that.	16
I have observed that.	17
I just dont think its right that.	26
One argument is favour of.	21
I think have the right to.	20
Look, its like this.	16
What i mean is.	11
The reason for this is.	18
The main problem is.	16
Just let me explain.	16
Well, the reason is.	16
Well, the thing is.	15
Above all we must keep in mind that.	28
Whats you opinion about	20
What do you think about it	21
Do you agree with me	16
The reason for.	12
One possible explanation is that.	28
Whats responsible for this effect is.	31
Let me explain.	12
Theres no doubt in my mind.	21
It could well be that.	17
I agree completely.	16
I agree entirely.	14
I entirely agree with you on that.	27
I completely agree with you on that.	29
Youre so right.	12
I think so, too.	12
I dont think so either.	18
Thats just my feeling.	18
Thats just my opinion.	18
Thats just how i see it, too.	22
Thats just how i feel about it, too.	28
Thats very good point.	18
Youve got a good point there.	23
Yes, of course.	12
Yes, absolutely marvellous.	24
Yes, definitely.	14
Thats exactly what i mean.	21
Thats exactly what i say.	20
Yes, thats obvious.	16
Thats exactly how i see it.	21
Thats what i think.	15
How very true.	11
Yes, indeed.	10
Im all in favor of what youve been saying.	33
Yes, i agree.	10
I think so too.	11
Thats a good point.	15
Neither do i.	10
That is logical.	13
I cant argue with that. disagree.	26
Im not sure about that.	18
The problem with that is.	20
But dont you feel that point.	23
Yes, perhaps, but.	15
Yes, possibly, although.	21
Yes, but on the other hand.	21
Yes, in a way.	10
Maybe, i suppose so.	16
Well, it depends.	14
I dont think its as simple as that.	27
I see what you mean, but i think thats not the whole story.	46
You may be right there.	18
Yes, but theres also another aspect to consider.	40
There is no doubt about it that.	25
I simply must agree with that.	24
I am of the same opinion.	19
I am of the same opinion as.	21
I completely agree with.	20
There are many reasons for.	22
I disagree with you, im afraid.	25
No, i really cant agree, im afraid.	28
I dont quite agree there.	20
Im not so certain all sure if thats true.	32
Im not so sure.	11
Im sorry i cant agree.	17
Do you really think so that	22
Do you really believe that	22
Im not convinced that.	18
Well, thats one way of looking at it, but, i have my doubts that.	51
You cant really mean that.	21
You dont really mean that, do you	27
I wouldnt say so.	13
I dont think youre right.	20
I dont think thats right.	20
Surely you dont mean that	21
I dont want to argue with you, but.	27
I cant go all the way with you on that point.	34
Are you seriously suggesting that	29
I have my problems with what youre saying.	34
I cant quite understand how.	23
Ive come to complain about.	22
Im disappointed with im fed up with.	29
It really is terrible that.	22
Im sorry i have to say this, but.	25
Forgive me for mentioning it, but.	28
Thats what i want to know.	20
Are you aware that	15
Im disappointed to hear that.	24
What are you going to do about it	26
Something ought to be done about it.	29
Look, i really must protest about.	28
Cant something be done to.	21
I really must apologize for this.	27
Well, theres nothing we can do about that, im afraid.	43
This isnt my fault, you know.	23
What do you expect me to do	21
Ill find out what has happened.	25
Im sorry you should take it that way.	29
Ill see what i can do.	16
You know what i think, i think that.	28
The point is.	10
As i see it.	8
The way i see it is.	14
I sometimes think that.	19
Wouldnt you say that	17
Wouldnt you agree that	19
Id just like to say that.	19
Well, ive heard that.	17
Dont you think its right to say that	29
Its my feeling that.	16
I tend to think that.	16
I think that.	10
I am sure that.	11
I believe that.	12
I dont feel.	9
In my experience.	14
I would suggest that.	17
I am certain that.	14
Without a doubt.	13
It is thought that.	15
Some people say that.	17
It is considered.	14
Generally experience.	19
According to me.	13
In my eyes.	8
From my perspective.	17
From my view point.	15
Id like to point out that.	20
Generally it is thought that.	24
Well, it is considered that.	23
It is generally accepted that.	25
My impression is that.	18
It goes without saying that.	23
I hold the view that.	16
Im of the opinion that.	18
No, thats not what im trying to say.	28
No, thats not what i mean.	20
All im saying is that.	17
I was thinking exactly that myself.	29
Ok, lets do that.	13
Yes, lets do that.	14
Thats a good idea.	14
Its a good idea, but.	16
But what if	9
Im not sure i understand your point.	29
Im sorry, could you repeat that	26
What do you mean by	15
Could you give me an example	23
Maybe, but it seems to me that.	24
I partly agree, but i still believe that.	33
I dont agree, in my opinion.	22
I completely disagree. to me.	23
Id say the exact opposite.	21
Thats not always the case.	21
No, im not so sure about that.	23
Thats an interesting point.	23
Ive never really thought about that.	30
Um, let me think.	13
Its hard to say.	12
Just a minute.	11
Wait, what about.	14
Can we just pause a second	21
Lets see.	7
One quick thing.	13
Just one thing.	12
Just let me say.	12
According to my personal opinion.	28
According to my professional opinion.	32
Answer that has always appealed to me.	31
As far as i can tell.	15
By my reckoning.	13
From my observation.	17
From my personal angle.	19
From my personal perspective.	25
From my personal standpoint.	24
From my prospective.	17
From my standpoint.	16
From where im sitting.	18
I am of the opinion that.	19
I conclude that.	13
I feel that.	9
I have observed.	13
I hold the belief that.	18
I maintain that.	13
I would argue that.	15
Ill state my view.	14
Im unconvinced that.	17
If i may opine.	11
If i may outline a response.	22
If you were to ask me.	16
In my book.	8
In my estimation.	14
In my mind.	8
In my own conceit.	14
In my valuation.	13
It occurs to me that.	16
It seems likely.	13
Many people think that.	19
It is often said that.	17
Everybody knows that.	18
According to scientists.	21
The research seems to suggest.	25
Apparently she was wrong.	21
Ive heard that.	12
Im afraid i have to disagree.	23
Im sorry to disagree with you, but.	28
Thats not entirely true.	20
With due respect, i believe it would be wrong to.	39
With due respect, i would only partly agree to that.	42
I feel it wouldnt be right to.	23
Though i agree with. it seems to me that.	31
Thats partly true, but.	19
I see your point, but.	17
Well, you could be right.	20
Yes, ok, but perhaps.	17
To some extent, i agree with you, but.	30
It sounds interesting, but.	23
Thats true, but.	13
Me too, but.	9
That seems obvious, but.	20
I accept what youre saying but.	25
It is only partly true that.	22
I can agree with that only with reservations.	37
That is not necessarily so.	22
It is not as simple as it seems.	24
Under certain circumstances.	25
Lets go on to another point.	22
Next, lets talk about.	18
Lets talk about that late.	21
I see your point, but i think.	23
Yes, i understand, but my opinion is that.	34
Thats all very interesting, but the problem is that.	43
Im afraid i cant quite agree with your point.	36
I think ive got your point, now let me respond to it.	41
I can see what youre saying. heres my reply.	34
We can see what youre saying. heres my reply.	35
Im sorry to interrupt, but youve misunderstood our point.	48
Excuse me, but thats not quite correct.	32
Sorry, i just have to disagree with your point.	38
Let me just respond to that, please.	29
Forgive me for interrupting, but i must respond to that.	46
Hold on a moment, thats not correct.	29
If you would allow me to add a comment here.	34
We pointed out that.	16
Our opponents have claimed that.	27
The first point i would like to raise is this.	36
Our position is the following.	25
Heres the main point i want to raise.	29
Id like to deal with two points here. the first is.	39
Im sorry to interrupt, but.	22
What do you reckon	15
Any thoughts on	13
Are people right in thinking	24
Are you in agreement with	21
Do you have any particular views on	29
Do you have any thoughts on	22
From your point of view	19
I know this is not your specialist subject, but.	39
I know you havent had long to think about this.	37
I know you havent had much time to think about this, but.	45
Id be interested to hear your views on.	31
What are your thoughts on	21
What would be your reaction if i said	30
Whats your position on	19
Would it be right to say	19
My position is the following.	24
Let me just retake my position.	25
Just to be clear, here is what i mean.	29
My fate, i will think, will be to have no fate.	36
I think.	6
As far as i know.	12
Well, if you ask me.	15
If you want my honest opinion.	24
Ive never come across the idea that.	29
To draw to a close id like to say that.	29
To have the final say in the matter.	28
To crown it all id like to say that.	27
Lets have a final look at.	20
It only remains for me to say.	23
I would like to sum up the chief points.	31
All things considered, the obvious conclusion to be drawn is that.	55
All in all, it is evident.	20
To draw to the conclusion id like to say that.	36
But right now our attention turns to.	30
Now, lets look at the situation in.	28
And now lets turn to.	16
I think what we can hope to do now is.	28
What is likely to happen is.	22
Lets move to another point.	22
Now it is going to be pleasure to explain to you.	38
That reminds me of.	15
Something similar happened to me.	28
I know exactly what you mean.	23
Where were we	11
Anyway, you were saying.	20
So as i was saying.	14
There is another side to this.	24
There are 2 ways of looking at this.	28
There are different view of.	23
It would be a mistake to think that.	28
It is not a final word on the matter.	28
It doesnt necessarily mean that.	27
Well, theres been a debate about this.	31
I take a different view at.	21
Many people oppose the viewpoint that.	32
My honest opinion would be that.	26
The point i would like to make is that.	30
I would like to say that.	19
I would like to add here that.	23
Is it okay if i add something here.	27
If i may interrupt, i would like to add that.	35
Excuse me for interrupting, but.	27
Let me jump in.	11
Do you mind if i jump in here	22
Can i jump in here	14
Do you mind if i come in here	22
I dont mean to intrude, but.	22
I dont mean to be rude, but.	21
May i interject	13
Would you mind explaining that a little more, please	44
Could you explain that more fully	28
Could you tell us a bit more about that	31
Could you please	14
Could you possibly tell me	22
Id really appreciate it if you could.	30
Id be very grateful if you could.	26
If possible, id like to know about.	28
In other words.	12
To put it another way.	17
Let me try that again.	17
Let me start over.	14
Let me explain that again.	21
Let me restate that.	16
Let me start that again.	19
Well, maybe, but im not sure about that.	32
He maybe correct but im not sure.	26
I can see your point, but im not sure i agree.	35
You dont suppose he wants to escape, do you	35
It doesnt appear that the situation will improve.	41
As a matter of fact.	15
Well, im not sure that is true because.	31
Im afraid youre missing the point.	28
I dont think that has anything do with the goal of our discussion.	53
I have doubt whether.	17
This is in complete contradiction to.	31
What is even worse.	15
I am of a different opinion because.	29
I cannot agree with this idea.	24
What i object to is.	15
Unlike i think.	12
There is more to it than that.	23
The problem is that.	16
Why dont we.	9
How about.	8
I suggest that we.	14
Lets revise.	10
How about going	13
Why dont we go	11
Couldnt we	9
Shall we	7
What would you say to	17
Does it matter if we	16
Would you like to	14
Lets go to.	8
Do you fancy.	10
We might as well.	13
Actually, what i meant was.	22
I actually suggested that we.	24
I meant to say that.	15
My idea was actually that we should.	29
What i meant by.	12
Ok. that makes sense.	16
You are absolutely right.	21
I feel the same.	12
Absolutely correct.	17
I totally agree	13
Tell me about it	13
I couldnt agree more	17
Me too	5
I was actually trying to suggest that.	31
I was actually trying to say that.	27
I was actually trying to explain that.	31
Lets see if i can explain myself better.	32
Let me try to explain that another way.	31
Im sorry but that is out of the question.	32
Unfortunately that is not possible.	30
No, lets not.	10
Well, id rather.	13
I dont feel like it.	15
I dislike going for a walk.	21
What an awful idea	15
Im not sure about that idea.	22
Id love to but.	11
I dont think it will work.	20
Im not very keen on.	15
I have a point id like to make.	23
Id like to add something here.	24
Id like to say something about your idea.	33
Sorry, im not quite sure what you mean.	31
Do you mean that	13
Im sorry, i dont quite follow.	24
I dont quite understand what youre saying.	35
In conclusion, the purpose of this discussion.	39
The goal of our discussion is to.	26
We have concluded that.	19

It doesnt affect me.	16
Thats an interesting question.	26

I think you get the idea.	19
I think ive made my point.	20

I dont know for sure.	16

I have my own doubts.	16
I dont believe this is true.	22
Theres some doubt in my mind that.	27
Im not a hundred percent sure.	24
I dont know yet.	12
Can i add something here.	20
Is it ok if i jump in for a moment.	25
If i may interrupt.	15

Do you mind if i add something.	24
Umm, well not really.	17
Excuse me, but in my opinion.	23

So, youre telling me.	17
Well, if that is the case.	20
Wait a minute.	11

I agree up to a point, but.	20
You could say that, however.	23
Thats out of question.	18
